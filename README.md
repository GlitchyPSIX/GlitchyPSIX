### GlitchyPSI

Name's Glitchy. As oppossed to common belief no I'm not a robot and this isn't my source code but hi

I'm a software engineer that develops stuff for SM64 machinima and other things of mine like games and stuff

I also make graphics because graphics are super cool

My main language is C#, second is JS. I am one of the heads in the [Project Comet](https://github.com/projectcomet64) organization which has all the SM64 stuff I work on.

Don't ask why this repo's main branch is callled ``"dominant"``
